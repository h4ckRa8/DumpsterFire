DumpsterFire is a comprehensive data erasure program designed to thoroughly rewrite the binary data of selected files before deleting them. 
The program provides four robust methods of data erasure. 
Simple Overwrite: The program will rewrite the binary data of selected files as all 0's and delete the file.
Random Overwrite: The program will rewrite the binary data of selected files with random data.
DoD 5220.22-M Standard: The program will rewrite the binary data of selected files using the DoD 7-pass data erasure method.
Cryptographic erasure: The program will encrypt selected files, delete the encryption key, and then delete the file. 

Click on the browse button to search or drag and drop files onto the interface. Choose an erasure method and let the program destroy all records of the files in question.
